Current popular data augmentation strategies, such as rotating and cropping, rely on parameterizable transformations: images are augmented by sampling transformation parameters and applying the resulting perturbation. However, many real world transformations, such as recolorization, are nonparametric; using these transformations in the optimization procedure increases the information each training image provides and can improve model generalization. Because nonparametric augmentations depend on a potentially intractable number of parameters, it is difficult to define the distribution of parameters that produce semantically meaningful perturbations. In this work, we model the valid space of a given nonparametric transformation via the null space of an associated operator. Instead of sampling from this high dimensional space to generate our perturbation, we select the point within it that maximally increases the loss. We thus generate adversarial perturbations that are structured and semantically meaningful. Using this scheme for data augmentation, we show improved test accuracy over state-of-the-art augmentation techniques used in computer vision tasks."} }
